# C-image-modify-program
This is the assignment I did for CSCB09. 

* A1 is a program which can read an ppm P3 image and do some basic operations.
* A2 is a program which can build a tree to search, print and insert the node using structure.
* A3 is a program which can search the most similar images in the whole dir and the subdirectories and return it. It can process it by one process or multiple processes.
